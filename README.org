* Color File
Color file is a package that you can use to colorize your minibuffer
information while you are browsing through buffers or files.

** Configuration
*** Command Configuration
To configure for which commands Color-File is active, there is a group
available "color-file-ivy. Within this group there are two things you
can customize:

- color-file-ivy-buffer-commands
- color-file-ivy-file-commands

These two things represent the commands for which the color
customization will be invoked.

*** Color Configuration
To Change the colors that appear for different modes enter your
configuration in the following way:

#+NAME: color-mode-configuration
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (setq color-file-ivy-colors
        '((text-mode . "Green")
          (lisp-mode . "Blue")
          (emacs-lisp-mode . "Brown")))
#+END_SRC

In the above example, all buffers of mode text-mode when invoking a
switch-buffer command will be colored green.

To change the colors that appear for different file types (using
regex), enter your configuration in the following way:

#+NAME: color-file-configuration
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (setq color-file-ivy-regex-file-colors
        '(("lisp$" . "Green")
          ("txt$" . "Blue")
          ("el$" . "Red")))
#+END_SRC

In the above example, all files ending with a "lisp" suffix will be
colored green.
